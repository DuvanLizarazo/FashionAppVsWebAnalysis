# Project Summary

This project involves analyzing customer data from an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online and offers in-store style advice sessions. The company wanted to understand which platform—mobile app or website—is more effective for generating customer purchases. To address this, we built and evaluated a linear regression model to predict the yearly amount spent by customers based on several factors.

The data provided includes information such as average session length of in-store advice, time spent on the mobile app, time spent on the website, and length of membership with the company. After exploring and visualizing the data, we identified that the "Length of Membership" was the most significant predictor of yearly expenditure.

We then proceeded to train a linear regression model using these features. The model's coefficients indicated that "Length of Membership" and "Time on App" were positively associated with higher spending, while "Time on Website" had a minimal effect.

The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics showed that the model makes reasonably accurate predictions, indicating a good fit to the data.

Overall, this project provided insights into customer behavior and helped the company make data-driven decisions on where to focus their efforts, highlighting the value of membership duration and app engagement as key drivers of customer spending. This analysis could serve as a foundation for further investigations and targeted marketing strategies.
